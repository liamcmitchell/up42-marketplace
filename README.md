## Thoughts

I spent around 4 hours on this, more than I wanted to. A big contributor was learning new tools/tech:

- Netlify
- Next.js
- SWR
- CSS grid

but on the plus side, I know some new things.

I purposely avoided mobile layout because that can be a huge rabbit hole, especially with something like the cart which is probably nicer as a modal opening from a fixed nav.

I would have preferred to use [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) and [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) but I didn't want to waste time so I just stayed with inline style objects which do the job.
