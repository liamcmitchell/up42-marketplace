- Starting from [netlify template](https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-netlify-starter)
- Clean, install prettier, tried setting TS up, compiler issue, reverted
- Layout, using inline styles for simplicity, not planning on doing mobile layout
- Data fetching, [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/getting-started) package is recommended by netlify docs, new to me
- Of course CORS is not enabled, need to proxy
- Filter results, add block component
- Can layout blocks with CSS grid now, first time using
- Add to cart
- Remove from cart
